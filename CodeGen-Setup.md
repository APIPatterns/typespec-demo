## Work in progress
This branch gives us the setup and instructions for doing code generation with the Azure Devloper CLI.

- azd init
- azd up
- open in dev container
- run genny.sh
- create api sample implementation
- azd deploy
- new python client
- generate client library from deployed api spec
- create main.py to show working api/client in practice
